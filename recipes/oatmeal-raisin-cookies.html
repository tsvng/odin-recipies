    <p>Make and enjoy these scrumptious oatmeal raisin cookies!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup (95 g) AP flour</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/16 tsp grated nutmeg (optional)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup softened butter (113 g)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (50 g) sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (110 g) packed dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tbsp toasted milk powder (7 g)</li>
      <li>1 tsp kosher salt (1/2 tsp if using fine table salt)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>

      <li>1 1/2 cups (130 g) rolled oats</li>
      <li>3/4 cup (120 g) raisins</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Soak raisins hot water for 30 minutes before any other steps.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li>Whisk together flour, cinnamon, and the optional nutmeg.</li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl cream together butter, sugars, salt, baking soda, and
        vanilla extract about 5 minutes on medium in a stand mixer or
        medium-high with hand mixer, being sure to scrape down sides of the bowl
        halfway.
      </li>
      <li>Add egg, mix until well combined about 1-2 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Fold in dry ingredients by hand or about 15 seconds on low, dry flour
        will still remain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold in oats and raisins(drained) by hand or about 15 seconds on low or
        until well combined.
      </li>
      <li>Portion dough into 3 tbsp scoops.</li>

      <li>
        Chill pre-portioned dough for an hour, up to three days in the fridge to
        develop more complex flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place dough on a baking sheet and bake for 12-14 minutes or until edges
        are browned and center is still soft and unset. Tip: You can try the
        "edge test". While the cookies are still in the oven, try slightly
        lifting the very edge of the cookie a bit without the cookie breaking
        apart. If you can do this, it is time to take them out of the oven to
        finish baking with the residual heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet before moving to a cooling
        rack.
      </li>
    </ol>
