    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A peanut butter and jelly sandwich (PB&J) consists of peanut butter and
      fruit preserves—jelly—spread on bread. The sandwich may be open-faced,
      made of a single slice of bread folded over, or made using two slices of
      bread. The sandwich is popular in the United States, especially among
      children; a 2002 survey showed the average American will eat 1,500 peanut
      butter and jelly sandwiches before graduating from high school.[1] There
      are many variations of the sandwich, starting with the basic peanut butter
      sandwich or jam sandwich.
